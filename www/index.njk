      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am a tech-savy activist with a dream to make the world a better place for all. I design and create original projects which help people and inspire empathy and action. My diverse range of experiences in neuroscience research, grass-roots activism, non-profit marketing, and  web design and development give me a uniquely wide base of skills from which to pull. In my spare time I organize <a href="http://liberationphilly.org" target="_blank">Liberation Philadelphia</a>, a <a href="http://uptwinkles.org/" target="_blank">vegan housing co-op</a>, and a <a href="https://uptwinkles.co/rat-sanctuary" target="_blank">microsanctuary for rats</a> rescued from human exploitation.</p>
