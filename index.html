    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a tech-savy activist with a dream to make the world a better place for all. I design and create original projects which help people and inspire empathy and action. My diverse range of experiences in neuroscience research, grass-roots activism, non-profit marketing, and  web design and development give me a uniquely wide base of skills from which to pull. In my spare time I organize Direct Action Everywhere's <a href="dxephilly.org" target="_blank">Philadelphia chapter</a>, <a href="http://phillyara.surge.sh/" target="_blank">the Philly Animal Rights Coalition</a>, and a burgeoning vegan housing co-op.</p>
